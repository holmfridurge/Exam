- Running the script
-- To be able to run this program the computer needs to have tkinter installed.


If 'Generate test' is chosen the user is redirected to a view where he is supposed to insert what the exported file is supposed to be named, the date of the test and how many questions he wants to get.
The program will then generate two files, one with only the questions and one with both the questions and the answers.

If 'Try taking a test' is chosen the user is redirected to a view where he gets a question and can insert the answer. We fell out of time so we couldn't fully implement to check whether the answer was right or wrong.

By clicking the Back button, the user can go back to the start view.
